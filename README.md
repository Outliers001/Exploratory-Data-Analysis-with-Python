# Exploratory Data Analysis with Python

## Overview
This repository is dedicated to Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) using Python. It includes a collection of tutorials, notebooks, and scripts that demonstrate key EDA techniques to clean, visualize, and understand datasets effectively. Whether you are a beginner or experienced data analyst, this repository provides valuable insights and tools to enhance your data analysis skills.

## Key Features
- Comprehensive EDA techniques using Python libraries like Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Plotly.
- Step-by-step guides with clear explanations and code examples.
- Visualization techniques to discover patterns, trends, and relationships in data.
- Handling missing data, outliers, and applying data transformations.
- Example projects and datasets to practice hands-on EDA.

## Contents
- `notebooks/`: Jupyter notebooks with detailed EDA examples.
- `datasets/`: Sample datasets used for analysis.
- `scripts/`: Python scripts to automate EDA tasks.
- `visualizations/`: Examples of various data visualizations.
  
## Installation
